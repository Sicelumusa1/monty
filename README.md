This is a collaborative project to learn C concepts of Stacks and Queues - LIFO and FIFO
Monty byte code files will be used as test files for implementation of Stacks and Queues functions/methods

0. push, pall
Implement the push and pall opcodes.
#The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
#The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

1. pint
Implement the pint opcode.
#The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

2. pop
Implement the pop opcode.
#The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

3. swap
Implement the swap opcode.
#The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. add
Implement the add opcode.
#The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. nop
Implement the nop opcode.
#The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything.
